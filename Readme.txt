Following are the prerequisites for execution of the code:

1)Python 2.7.2
2) csv module
3)Scikit learn library
4) nltk toolkit for python and stop words corpora installed

The code can be executed using the command:

python sentiment_analysis.py Data.csv 10000

Note:
1)The number 100000 can be changed to any number greater than 10 to increase the number of tweets being utilized.
Decreasing this number decreases the execution time as well
